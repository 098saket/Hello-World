Hi Everyone!
I am Shreya.
I am an undergraduate student at Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India.
Check out my ![github profile](https://github.com/shreyateeza)

A year ago I too was completely new to github and felt if someone could help me so I created the Novice Paradigm to help people get started with open source and exploring this virtual world.

If you have any query, suggestion or an idea that you think can help this organisation, then feel free to reach me!
