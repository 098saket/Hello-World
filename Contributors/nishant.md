Hi,
I'm a sopohomer in electrical dept. at IIT Roorkee.I have been doing programming(competitive) from my freshman year only. Recently i developed an interst in open source community and would like to learn and contribute.
Currently i'm doing a ML course and side by side learning how to use version controls like git and github.
This is my first github repository.
