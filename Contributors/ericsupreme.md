hey everyone i am eric , i reside in atlanta ga(usa) and i am a long long lol time IT network guy (current job) who has been dabbling and teaching myself to code the past couple years and i am finally ready to get serious. ruby is my favorite and main focus but i am also very familiar with javascript, angular, html, and css.
my next goal is to learn a static language i.e java , rust etc.

i believe this is an excellent idea and looking forward to working on this project and seeing it grow! :)

github username is ericsupreme https://github.com/ericsupreme
