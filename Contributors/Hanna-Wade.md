Hi Everybody!

My name is Hanna Wade. I am currently an undergraduate student at DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, USA. 

I am majoring in computer science and philosophy (with an emphasis on computability theory) and will graduate in May of 2019.
I am hoping to spend my summer finding my niche before setting out for a career after graduating. I am hoping the open source
world will help me find projects that I enjoy and narrow down my industry/computing interests!

I would love to chat/hear any advice you may have!
-Hanna :)
